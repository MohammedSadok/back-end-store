# eCommerce API with JWT Authentication

This API serves as the backend for an eCommerce application, providing secure access to various resources such as users, products, orders, and categories. The API is secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to sensitive data and endpoints.

## Key Features:

- User authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- CRUD operations for users, products, orders, and categories.
- User registration and login functionalities.
- Secure endpoints for managing user profiles, product listings, and order processing.
- Integration with Spring Security to handle authentication and authorization logic.

## Technologies Used:

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Hibernate/JPA
- RESTful API
- MySQL/PostgreSQL (or your preferred database)
- [Any other technologies/frameworks used in your project]

## How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your development environment with JDK, Maven, and your preferred IDE.
3. Configure the database connection in `application.properties` file.
4. Build and run the application.
5. Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or integrate it with your frontend application.

## Security Measures:

- JWT tokens are used for authentication, providing a secure and stateless mechanism for user authorization.
- Passwords are securely hashed before storing them in the database, ensuring confidentiality.
- Secure endpoints are protected using Spring Security configurations, restricting access to authenticated users only.
